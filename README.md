# Minor notes

Requires Node v16 currently, so use NVM to jump between v16 when you have to build or serve the codebase

To refer back to a deployed example, and read the style guide when you need to

- Deployed example can be found here: https://vuepress-theme-meteorlxy.meteorlxy.cn/posts/2019/02/27/theme-guide-en.html

- This template allows you to set up comments if you want to for posts
- I decided against setting it up
- I wrote about this more in an article on the site here: /docs/_posts/2023-07-01-how-to-set-up-comments-for-this-theme.md
- Its just a draft and wont appear on my site
- Its just a reminder to myself

# The guts

`npm run dev` to get it up on localhost
