Postel's Law or The Robustness Principle, is [simply defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) as "be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept"

The application is, whenever machines need to talk to one-another, that they should accept messages that might not be perfectly formatted but the intention/message is clear, but should be very rigid in what they send.

If you send a message, you should ensure you conform completely to the specification/standards that governs your message format (JSON for example) but be flexible when receiving messages and ensure you don't crash/error if the input is malformed to you.
