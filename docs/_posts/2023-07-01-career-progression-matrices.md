Discussing how people improve as software engineers is something I really enjoy studying, thinking and reading about.

I have written in the past about:

- [How to improve as a developer, even when it's hard](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-better-at-programming-even-when-its-hard/)
- [My 4 best tips to improve as a developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-better-developer/)

I love thinking/reading about questions like:

- How do people progress professionally as engineers?
- How do developers go [from Senior to Staff](https://staffeng.com/) or beyond?
- How do Engineer scale themselves?

Part of the answer I think, is looking at:

- Compotency Matrices and Career Progression ladders companies put out to explain what they expect in each role.
Individual opinions from industry experts who have gone from Mid-Level Engineer to CTO (etc)
- Trying to look and standardise what totally different companies search for - helps you understand what is valuable in the marketplace.

This has led me to compiling around 70 publicly accessible career matrices from companies around the world, from places like:

- Soundcloud
- Dropbox
- Etsy
- Gov.uk
- Medium
- Khan Academy
- Circle CI
- Monzo
- Patreon
- Financial Times

You can read them all [here](https://github.com/kealanparr/Career-progression-matrices)

I've been spending time looking at areas where I'm strong and looking where I'm weaker too - searching for ways I can grow & improve.

I hope this is of use to you too!
