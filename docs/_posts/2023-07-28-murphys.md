Murphys Law is a simple law that states "anything that can go wrong, *will* go wrong"

Generally, in software it applies to unexpected bad luck that seems to keep cropping up.

There are so many random events that sometimes can't be forseen and planned for in life, let alone the software development lifecycle, and Murphy's Law rather pessimistically advises us to get ready for anything that can go wrong, to do so.
