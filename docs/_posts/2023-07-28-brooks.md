Have you ever worked on a software project that is late?

The normal approach from management to solve this, is to throw more developer's on the project to try and deliver it as fast as possible.

Brook's Law states that [adding manpower to a late software project makes it later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law#cite_note-2)

The most common way I have seen this happen over and over again is with familiarity with the project.

Let's say you have 2 developers on this late project who are very familiar with the code and the way it works, but just gave bad estimates in the early stages when they were planning.

Now management decide to throw 4 more developers on the project to try and deliver it as quick as possible
