# How to Model Anything

Modelling things helps us to understand complex interactions with multiple chaotic elements, where multiple inputs all contribute in a complex way to produce an output.

Want to model how a city would be affected by an infectious disease? Or a warehouse conveyor belt? Simulate an air defence by the military? Or maybe even a yard sale's wealth model?

The fascinating part of modelling is visualising bottlenecks in the environment of something you've modelled.

All of these have been simulated on: https://hash.ai/

You can read about their mission [here](https://hash.ai/about/mission)

Feel free to create your own simulations [here](https://core.hash.ai/@hash/wildfires-regrowth/9.3.3), search [here](https://hash.ai/index) or look at the popular ones at the minute [here](https://hash.ai/models?sort=popularity).

Sharing as I saw some fascinating stuff on here, and wanted to let others know if they haven't seen it.
