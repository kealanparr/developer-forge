Docker is a useful technology to learn before Kubernetes, so I'd start [here](https://developer-forge.com/posts/2023/07/01/how-to-learn-docker.html)



Firstly, read [this](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-ecosystems/how-docker-and-kubernetes-work-together)

Next, I'd look at a [cool tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-interactive/) to help you:
- Manage your first cluster
- Explore clusters
- Deploy clusters

Finally, I'd code along and read [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-kubernetes-in-under-3-hours-a-detailed-guide-to-orchestrating-containers-114ff420e882/)
